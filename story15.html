        <h1>Laugh Out Loud</h1>
        <p>
            It was the annual talent show at Greenfield High, and nobody was more excited than Max. Known as the class clown, he had a reputation to uphold. But this year, he was determined to do something unforgettable. He wasn’t going to pull his usual pranks—he was going to do stand-up comedy.
        </p>
        <p>
            “You’re going to bomb,” his best friend Jake warned. “Telling jokes in class is one thing, but on stage? That’s another level.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Max grinned. “Oh, ye of little faith! Just wait and see.”
        </p>
        <p>
            On the day of the talent show, Max was a bundle of nerves. He had spent weeks crafting the perfect routine—jokes about teachers, cafeteria food, and the horror of school group projects. As he stood backstage, his palms were sweaty, his heart pounded, and for the first time in his life, he wished he had chosen to do a magic trick instead.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Next up, we have Max Turner!” the announcer called.
        </p>
        <p>
            Taking a deep breath, Max stepped onto the stage, greeted by a mix of cheers and skeptical glances. He adjusted the microphone, cleared his throat, and began.
        </p>
        <p>
            “So, who here loves cafeteria food?” he asked.
        </p>
        <p>
            Silence.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Exactly! I swear, I saw something moving in my mashed potatoes last week. I think it tried to eat my fork.”
        </p>
        <p>
            A few chuckles. Encouraged, Max went on. He talked about Mr. Johnson’s ridiculous toupee, the principal’s obsession with morning announcements, and how gym class felt like a medieval torture session.
        </p>
        <p>
            Soon, the laughter grew. People clapped, howled, and some even wiped away tears. Max was on fire! By the time he finished, the entire auditorium was in stitches. He took a dramatic bow, his chest swelling with pride.
        </p>
        <p>
            Backstage, Jake gaped. “Dude, you killed it! That was amazing!”
        </p>
        <p>
            Max shrugged modestly. “Well, they say laughter is the best medicine.”
        </p>
        <p>
            The next day at school, Max became a legend. Teachers gave him amused glances, students high-fived him in the hallways, and someone even put up a poster with his best jokes.
        </p>
        <p>
            As he sat in class, Max knew one thing for sure—this wasn’t the last time he’d be making people laugh. Because nothing, absolutely nothing, felt as good as hearing an entire room burst into laughter.
