        <h1>Shadow in the Night</h1>
        <p>The town of Ravenwood had always been a quiet place. Nestled between thick forests and fog-covered hills, it was the kind of town where everyone knew each other. But when the shadows began moving at night, fear spread through the town like wildfire.</p>
        
        <p>It started with whispers—people claiming they saw dark figures lurking in the streets, disappearing the moment they were spotted. No one could explain it. Some said it was a trick of the light, others blamed the wind rustling the trees. But then, Mrs. Hawthorne disappeared.</p>
        
        <p>Mrs. Hawthorne had lived in Ravenwood for over fifty years. A sweet old woman who never missed a Sunday at church. One evening, her neighbor, James Carter, saw a shadow lingering outside her home. Thinking it was a stray dog, he went to check. But as he approached, the shadow slithered across the ground and vanished. The next morning, Mrs. Hawthorne was gone, her door left ajar, her tea still warm on the table.</p>
        
        <p>The town’s sheriff, Tom Williams, was a man of reason. He didn’t believe in ghost stories. But after four more people went missing under similar circumstances, he knew something was wrong. Determined to uncover the truth, he set up night patrols and installed cameras around the town. But all they captured were fleeting glimpses—dark shapes moving just out of focus.</p>
        
        <p>One night, Tom decided to patrol alone. Armed with nothing but a flashlight and his pistol, he walked the deserted streets. The town was eerily silent, save for the soft chirping of crickets. Then, he heard it—a whisper, faint and chilling. “Leave while you can.”</p>
        
        <p>Tom spun around, his flashlight cutting through the darkness. Nothing. He took a cautious step forward. Then another. The whisper came again, this time closer. He could feel the hairs on his arms stand up. And then, he saw it—a figure, tall and shrouded in darkness, standing at the end of the street.</p>
        
        <p>He called out. No response. Slowly, he raised his flashlight, and as the beam landed on the figure, it dissolved into the shadows, reforming behind him. A cold breath tickled his neck. He turned and fired his gun, but the figure had vanished.</p>
        
        <p>Panic surged through him as he ran back to his car. He knew now—this wasn’t a person. This was something else. Something ancient. Something that thrived in the darkness.</p>
        
        <p>The next morning, Tom called for an emergency town meeting. He warned the townsfolk to stay indoors after dark, to lock their doors, and to keep their lights on. And for a while, the disappearances stopped.</p>
        
        <p>But late at night, when the streets are empty and the wind whispers through the trees, some say you can still see them—shadows shifting in the corners of your vision, watching, waiting.</p>
