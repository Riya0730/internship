        <h1>Unwritten Letters</h1>
        <p>
            Sarah sat by the old oak desk, staring at the pile of letters that had never been sent. Each one was a story, a memory, a feeling she had poured onto paper but never had the courage to mail. For years, she had written letters to David, the love she had lost but never truly let go. 
        </p>
        <p>
            It had been ten years since their last meeting. They had parted with unspoken words, with emotions bottled up, thinking they had all the time in the world. But time had a way of slipping through their fingers, and before Sarah realized, a decade had passed. 
        </p>
        <p>
            One evening, as she was cleaning out her attic, she stumbled upon a small wooden box. Inside were letters dated from years ago, each addressed to David. As she read through them, memories flooded her mind—their long walks along the river, the way he made her laugh, the dreams they once shared. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Overcome with nostalgia, she made a decision. She would finally send the letters. Sarah searched online and found David’s current address. He had moved to a small town by the sea. Gathering the letters, she carefully placed them in an envelope, her hands trembling as she wrote his name. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Days passed, and soon, a letter arrived in return. It was from David. With bated breath, she opened it. 
        </p>
        <p>
            “Sarah,
            
            I never expected to hear from you again. When I saw your name on the envelope, my heart skipped a beat. I, too, have written letters to you over the years, but I never sent them. I thought you had moved on, forgotten me. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Life took us in different directions, but not a day passed without a thought of you. Your words brought back memories I had locked away, afraid they would hurt too much. Now I see that some love never fades. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I am living by the sea now, running a small bookstore. If you ever wish to visit, the door is always open.
        </p>
        <p>
            With love,
            David.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Tears streamed down Sarah’s face as she finished reading. She realized that the letters she had never sent had still found their way to where they belonged. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The next morning, she packed a bag and bought a train ticket. It was time to write a new chapter—not in ink, but in moments, in second chances, and in the love that had waited a decade to be rekindled.
