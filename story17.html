        <h1>The Hidden Trap</h1>
        <p>Detective Alan Carter never ignored a clue, no matter how small. When a wealthy businessman, Robert Hayes, vanished without a trace, Alan knew this case was different. The last known location was an abandoned mansion on the outskirts of town—a place shrouded in mystery and fear.</p>
        
        <p>Alan arrived at the eerie mansion just before midnight. The air smelled of damp wood, and the wind howled through the broken windows. He pushed open the creaky door and stepped inside. Dust covered the furniture, and cobwebs hung from the ceiling. Something wasn’t right. A half-drunk cup of coffee sat on a table—recently placed.</p>
        
        <p>Alan’s instincts kicked in. He moved cautiously through the rooms, his flashlight scanning every corner. He noticed footprints in the dust, leading to a bookshelf. He pushed it, and it swung open, revealing a hidden staircase descending into darkness.</p>
        
        <p>With his heart pounding, Alan descended. The basement smelled of mildew and something more sinister—blood. His flashlight flickered, revealing chains bolted to the wall. His gut told him Robert had been here.</p>
        
        <p>Suddenly, the door slammed shut above him. He spun around. A shadow emerged from the darkness. A man in a dark hooded coat stepped forward, a sinister grin on his face.</p>
        
        <p>“Detective Carter, I’ve been expecting you,” the man said.</p>
        
        <p>Alan clenched his fists. “Where’s Robert?”</p>
        
        <p>The man chuckled. “Let’s just say he walked into a trap, just like you.”</p>
        
        <p>Alan’s eyes darted around the room. A faint groan came from the corner. He stepped closer and found Robert tied to a chair, weak but alive. Relief washed over him—but only for a moment.</p>
        
        <p>The man lunged. Alan dodged and countered with a punch. They struggled, knocking over old shelves and scattering debris. The man grabbed a rusted knife and slashed at Alan, who barely dodged in time. Using his training, Alan managed to disarm him and knock him unconscious.</p>
        
        <p>Alan freed Robert and guided him upstairs. But as they reached the main hall, they heard a ticking sound. A bomb.</p>
        
        <p>“Run!” Alan shouted.</p>
        
        <p>They bolted out just as an explosion tore through the mansion. The force threw them forward, but they were safe. As the dust settled, sirens wailed in the distance. The police had arrived.</p>
        
        <p>Robert, still shaken, looked at Alan. “I owe you my life.”</p>
        
        <p>Alan gave a tired smile. “Just another day on the job.”</p>
        
        <p>As the mansion burned, Alan knew this was only the beginning. The real mastermind was still out there, watching, waiting. And Alan was ready for the next hidden trap.</p>
