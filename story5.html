        <h1>Love in the Rain</h1>
        <p>
            It was a quiet evening in the city of Mumbai. The monsoon had arrived in its full glory, drenching the bustling streets and painting the skies a moody shade of grey. Among the crowds rushing for shelter, Aarav stood still, gazing at the rain with a soft smile on his lips. He had always loved the rain. It reminded him of simpler times, of childhood laughter, and of a love that once seemed lost forever.
        </p>
        <p>
            Just as he was about to walk away, he saw her—Meera. She stood across the street, struggling with her umbrella as the wind played with her long, dark hair. His heart skipped a beat. It had been five years since they had last seen each other. Aarav had moved to Delhi for work, and time had built a wall between them. But seeing her now, in the middle of the rain-soaked street, made all those years disappear in an instant.
        </p>
        <p>
            Summoning his courage, Aarav crossed the road, his shoes splashing through the puddles. "Meera?" he called out hesitantly.
        </p>
        <p>
            She turned, her deep brown eyes widening in surprise. "Aarav!" A mixture of emotions flickered across her face—shock, happiness, and a touch of pain. "What are you doing here?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "I just moved back last week," he said, his voice barely audible over the rain. "I never thought I'd run into you like this."
        </p>
        <p>
            She smiled, tucking a strand of wet hair behind her ear. "Neither did I."
        </p>
        <p>
            They stood there in silence, the sound of raindrops filling the space between them. The years apart had created a distance, but in this moment, standing in the rain just like they used to in college, that distance felt small.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Do you want to grab a coffee?" Aarav finally asked.
        </p>
        <p>
            Meera hesitated for a second before nodding. "I'd like that."
        </p>
        <p>
            They walked together to a small café nearby, their clothes damp but their hearts warm. As they sipped on steaming cups of coffee, laughter replaced awkward silences. They spoke about their lives, their careers, the paths they had taken. It was as if the rain had washed away all the regrets of the past.
        </p>
        <p>
            "I missed this," Aarav admitted. "I missed us."
        </p>
        <p>
            Meera looked into his eyes, and for the first time in years, she let herself feel everything she had buried. "I missed us too."
        </p>
        <p>
            As the rain continued to pour outside, two hearts found their way back to each other, proving that sometimes, love—like the rain—has a way of returning when you least expect it.
