        <h1>The Clumsy Detective</h1>
        <p>Detective Arnold Thompson was not known for his grace. In fact, the police station had an unspoken rule—keep anything fragile out of his reach. Yet, despite his clumsiness, Arnold had an uncanny ability to solve even the most perplexing cases.</p>
        
        <p>One afternoon, a frantic call came in from Mrs. Pennington, the wealthy widow who owned the largest mansion in town. "My diamond necklace is gone!" she cried. "I had it last night, and now it's vanished!"</p>
        
        <p>Detective Arnold rushed to the scene, knocking over a coat rack on his way out of the station. Arriving at the mansion, he stepped onto the plush carpet, only to trip over a stray shoe and land right at Mrs. Pennington's feet. "Fear not, madam!" he declared from the floor. "I will find your necklace!"</p>
        
        <p>He began his investigation by questioning the butler, Mr. Higgins. "Where were you last night?" Arnold asked, adjusting his crooked glasses.
        "Serving dinner, sir."
        "And after?"
        "Washing dishes, sir."
        "And after that?"
        "Going to bed, sir."
        "Very well, you may go," Arnold said, turning dramatically—only to knock over a vase. It shattered, sending shards everywhere.
        "Oh dear," he muttered. "Let’s pretend that didn’t happen."</p>
        
        <p>Next, he questioned the maid, Clara. "Did you see anything suspicious?"
        "No, sir. I was cleaning the drawing-room."
        "And was the necklace in its usual place?"
        "Yes, sir, on the dresser."
        "Hmm," Arnold said, rubbing his chin—smudging ink all over his face from the pen he had accidentally uncapped in his pocket.</p>
        
        <p>Determined to find a clue, Arnold decided to inspect the bedroom. As he bent down to examine the carpet, his coat caught on the dresser handle, yanking it open. Out fell a note: "Meet me at midnight by the garden fountain."</p>
        
        <p>"Aha! A clue!" Arnold exclaimed, only to stand up too quickly and bump his head on the dresser. Rubbing his forehead, he hurried outside to the garden. He waited by the fountain, peering through the darkness.</p>
        
        <p>Soon, a shadowy figure appeared. "Got the necklace?" the voice whispered.
        "Indeed, I do!" Arnold declared, switching on his flashlight. To his shock, it was none other than Mr. Higgins!
        "You?!" Arnold gasped, tripping over his own shoelace and knocking over a potted plant.</p>
        
        <p>Higgins sighed. "Yes, I took the necklace. But I was returning it! I just wanted to teach Mrs. Pennington a lesson for never appreciating me!"
        "A-ha! Caught red-handed!" Arnold said, though his finger was accidentally pointing at the ground instead of Higgins. "You are under arrest!"</p>
        
        <p>The police arrived to take Higgins away. Mrs. Pennington was overjoyed. "Detective Arnold, you are a genius!"
        "Oh, well," Arnold said, adjusting his glasses and knocking over yet another vase. "Just another day’s work!"</p>
