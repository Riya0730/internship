        <h1>The Haunted Cabin</h1>
        <p>Jason had always been a skeptic when it came to ghosts. So when his friends dared him to spend a night in the old, abandoned cabin on the edge of the forest, he accepted without hesitation. The cabin had a reputation—locals whispered about eerie lights, strange noises, and people who entered but never returned.</p>
        <p>With only a flashlight and a sleeping bag, Jason pushed open the creaky wooden door. Dust swirled in the moonlight streaming through broken windows. He took a deep breath and stepped inside. The air smelled of damp wood and decay.</p>
        <p>As the night deepened, Jason settled into a corner, determined to prove there was nothing to fear. But then, the whispers began. Soft at first, like the wind rustling leaves, but soon growing distinct—voices murmuring in an unrecognizable language.</p>
        <p>Jason's heart pounded. He shined his flashlight toward the sound, revealing a rocking chair moving on its own. He stumbled backward, tripping over a loose floorboard. Beneath it, he found an old diary, its pages brittle with age.</p>
        <p>The diary belonged to a woman named Eleanor, who had lived in the cabin a century ago. Her final entry sent chills down Jason’s spine: "They come for me at night. I hear them whisper my name. I fear I shall not see the morning. If anyone reads this, leave while you can."</p>
        <p>Suddenly, the whispers turned into wails. The temperature dropped, and Jason could see his breath in the air. The flashlight flickered, and shadows danced along the walls. A figure formed in the corner, its hollow eyes fixed on him.</p>
        <p>Panicked, Jason grabbed the diary and bolted for the door, but it slammed shut before he could reach it. He pounded on the wood, screaming for help. The wails grew deafening. Just as Jason felt himself being pulled into the darkness, the first rays of dawn peeked through the windows. The whispers ceased. The door creaked open.</p>
        <p>Jason ran without looking back. He never spoke of that night, but he left the diary at the town’s historical society. Researchers later found records of Eleanor’s disappearance—and the eerie truth that everyone who had stayed in that cabin alone had vanished, except Jason.</p>
        <p>Perhaps, they said, the ghosts had spared him to spread their warning.</p>
