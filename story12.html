        <h1>The Mischievous Prank</h1>
        <p>It was a bright summer morning in Oakwood High, and the students were eagerly preparing for the annual school fair. Among them was Jake, the notorious prankster of the school. He had an unparalleled reputation for his mischievous antics, and this year, he planned something grand—a prank so legendary that it would be talked about for years.</p>
        
        <p>Jake’s target was none other than Mr. Harrison, the strict and grumpy history teacher who had a zero-tolerance policy for pranks. With the help of his best friends, Tom and Lily, Jake devised a plan. He would replace the announcement speaker in Mr. Harrison’s classroom with a pre-recorded voice message that would hilariously mispronounce historical names and give absurd facts.</p>
        
        <p>On the morning of the fair, Jake sneaked into the classroom before the first bell rang. He carefully connected the pre-recorded device to the intercom system and set it on a timer. At exactly 10 AM, when Mr. Harrison was delivering one of his stern lectures, the system would go off.</p>
        
        <p>As the fair began, Jake and his friends eagerly waited near the history classroom. At precisely 10 AM, the intercom crackled to life. Instead of Mr. Harrison’s serious voice, a robotic yet exaggerated voice echoed through the room:</p>
        
        <p><i>“Good morning, students! Did you know that Napoleon Bonaparte was actually a world-famous chef who invented French fries?”</i></p>
        
        <p>The class erupted into laughter. Mr. Harrison, baffled and red-faced, tried to turn off the intercom, but the device continued.</p>
        
        <p><i>“Julius Caesar once won a dance battle against Cleopatra. Historians agree he had the best moves in Rome!”</i></p>
        
        <p>The students couldn’t control their laughter. Even the usually serious Mr. Harrison cracked a small smile before regaining his composure. He stormed towards the intercom to unplug it, but before he could, the final statement boomed:</p>
        
        <p><i>“And finally, Mr. Harrison secretly loves pop music and can moonwalk like Michael Jackson!”</i></p>
        
        <p>The entire school, including teachers, burst into laughter as the fairgrounds heard the announcement through the shared speakers. Mr. Harrison shook his head, but instead of scolding, he chuckled and said, “Alright, Jake, you got me this time!”</p>
        
        <p>Jake, standing outside the classroom, felt a mixture of relief and victory. Not only had his prank been successful, but for the first time, Mr. Harrison had laughed at one of his antics. That day, Jake learned that sometimes, even the strictest people appreciate a little humor.</p>
